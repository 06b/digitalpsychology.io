We feel a sense of obligation to return favors to people who have done something for us. This rule works not only with people you know but also with strangers. It's a human characteristic that allows us to live as a society.


### Studies

In an experiment, subject thought they were evaluating art. Also in the room was a fellow participant, who was in reality a research assistant. In one condition, the assistant would leave the room and bring back two cans of Coke - for him and the subject. In another condition, he would return empty-handed. At the end of the experiment, the assistant asked the participants if they would buy a raffle ticket from him. As expected, the subjects who had received the gift were twice more likely to purchase tickets, even though the tickets were far more expensive than the can of soda had been.

Even very inexpensive meals (< $20) sponsored by pharmaceutical firms led to an increase in physician prescriptions of the promoted brand-name medication. ([DeJong et al.,  2016](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2528290))
