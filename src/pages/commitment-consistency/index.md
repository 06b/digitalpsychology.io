We are driven to be consistent in all areas of life. When we make a promise, we feel obligated to fulfill. When we make a decision, have an opinion or act in a particular manner, we strive to make all future behaviors match the past actions and decisions. We tend to justify these commitments by seeking confirmation and providing reasons for supporting them.
