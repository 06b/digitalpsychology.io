We are driven to be consistent in all areas of life. When we make a promise, we feel obligated to fulfill. When we make a decision, have an opinion or act in a particular manner, we strive to make all future behaviors match the past actions and decisions. We tend to justify these commitments by seeking confirmation and providing reasons for supporting them.


## Studies

Everyone knows or was even a part of projects where costs exploded by many times. Sometimes managers and even entire organizations seem almost programmed to follow a direction which is doomed to failure. **Escalation of commitment** refers to the tendency to stay with a decision and to dedicate additional effort, money and time into a course of action that is failing. We [don't want to lose](/loss-aversion/) the resources already invested and don't want to appear inconsistent. ([Staw, 1976](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.3668&rep=rep1&type=pdf))

"I will keep reading this book that I'm 100 pages into although I don't really like it." Sounds familiar? Sure, you spent the money on the book and your time already but you canâ€™t get it back. This distortion of our decisions by emotional investments is called the **sunk cost fallacy**.  It leads us to continue a behavior as a result of previously invested resources. ([Arkes & Blumer, 1985](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.452.2318&rep=rep1&type=pdf))

The **Ikea effect** is a cognitive bias in which we disproportionately value things more if we put work in them. This phenomenon has a range of possible explanations: A successful completion of a task gives us the feeling of competence and puts us in a positive mood. Another reason could be that we like to justify the efforts that we've invested in a product, so we tend to like it more. ([Norton, Mochon, & Ariely, 2012](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=41121))

People use the current situation as a reference point, and any change from that is perceived as a loss. We prefer familiarity and tend to resist change. This phenomenon is known as the **status quo bias**. ([Samuelson & Zeckhauser, 1988](https://sites.hks.harvard.edu/fs/rzeckhau/SQBDM.pdf))
