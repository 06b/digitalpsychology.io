We are driven to be consistent in all areas of life. When we make a promise, we feel obligated to fulfill. When we make a decision, have an opinion or act in a particular manner, we strive to make all future behaviors match the past actions and decisions. We tend to justify these commitments by seeking confirmation and providing reasons for supporting them.


## Studies

Everyone knows or was even a part of projects where costs exploded by many times. Sometimes managers and even entire organizations seem almost programmed to follow a direction which is doomed to failure. *Escalation of commitment* refers to the tendency to stay with a decision and to dedicate additional effort, money and time into a course of action that is failing. We don't want to lose the resources already invested and don't want to appear inconsistent. ([Staw, 1976](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.3668&rep=rep1&type=pdf))
