*"When you say it, it's marketing. When your customer says it, it's social proof."* Andy Crestodina

People are pack animals. We are more likely to do something when presented with evidence that others have done it, more than we are willing to admit. This behavior applies in particular when we are unsure what to do.


## Studies

A study found that a one-star increase in Yelp ratings led to a 5-9% growth in sales. ([Luca, 2011](https://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/67460062))

92% of people trust recommendations from their peers, and 70% of the consumers trust a recommendation from someone they don’t even know. ([Nielsen, 2012](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2012/trust-in-advertising--paid-owned-and-earned.html))


## Examples


### Testimonials
Displaying quotes from happy customers is one of the most used and most persuasive forms of social proof online. Be sure to add a high-quality photo to boost the perceived credibility ([Newman, Garry, Bernstein, Kantner & Lindsay, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22869334)).

### Social shares
Showing the raw number of social shares is a simple form of implementing social proof. People are more likely to read an article that has been shared by thousands. It gives it more credibility and encourages even more shares. But be careful. A low share count can create a negative social proof and is worse than no share count at all. People might think that the content you're providing isn’t good enough. [In an experiment by VWO](https://vwo.com/blog/removing-social-sharing-buttons-from-ecommerce-product-page-increase-conversions/), the removal of social sharing buttons led to an 11.9% conversion increase.

### Accumulated share count
Instead of displaying every counter separately, you can show the total number of shares across the different social networks to expose the user to an even higher number.

### Subscriber count
Show the people how many fans, subscribers or followers you have. You can use the official [Twitter follow button](https://publish.twitter.com/#), the [Facebook page plugin](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/page-plugin) or the provided plugin of the community of your choice. Most bigger platforms also provide a public API for developers, where alternatively the subscriber count can be fetched from.

### Reviews
According to the [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/12/19/online-reviews/), 82% of Americans read reviews before making a buying decision, and this prepurchase ritual is growing. Furthermore, we are paying more attention to highly negative reviews than to the extremely positive ones. Therefore check review sites like Yelp regularly to know what's being said about your brand and products. If you own an e-commerce store, displaying customer reviews can increase the conversion rate by [207%](https://www.yotpo.com/blog/ecommerce-conversion-rate/). A healthy mix of positive and [negative customer reviews](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/negative-reviews/) is more trustworthy and can even improve conversions.

### Influencer endorsements
Give your product away for free to people with a high social media influence in a niche area and ask them for feedback. Another way is to sponsor these (micro) influencers to post your product on their channels. Since they have a positive reputation, people tend to associate this positivity with anything else they are involved with. This cognitive bias is called the Halo Effect.

### Quoting celebrities
Instead of having someone talk about your product, find a quote from a celebrity or an influencer that supports a bigger picture of your industry. Even they are not directly associated with your product, showing a quote with a picture of them can add social proof.

### Customer case studies
Tell an in-depth story of how some of your customers use your product. This technique does provide not only social proof but also gives other potential clients ideas how to use your product or service.

### Media mentions
Did a recognized media outlet give you a positive endorsement? Let others know it by featuring their logo in a classical "as seen in" showcase or by quoting positive things they say. Consumers often trust big publishers, so showing that they have mentioned you, improves your brand's legitimacy and trustworthiness.

### Integrations
List other well-known products your service integrates with. Similar to the media mentions or quotes from celebrities there can also show up the Halo Effect which can positively influence your brand's credibility.

### Raw numbers
Expose your visitors to huge numbers on anything from your mailing list, customer base or the number of downloads to any relevant statistics that reminds potential customers that a large crowd is using your service – so it must be good enough for them. Wordpress, for example, uses this powerful tactic in the headline of their landing page: "WordPress powers 28% of the internet".

### Numbers in social account bio
You can even go further and not only mention these figures on your website but also in the description field of your social media accounts.
