We as humans don't like to leave things incomplete. We are motivated to finish a set of tasks even with no further reward other than the satisfaction of completion.


## Studies

During the Christmas season in 2016, Harvard researchers conducted a study with the Canadian Red Cross. Potential donors were directed to one of three landing pages. The first group received a request for cash donations. The second group was asked to select gifts from a selection of six items like blankets, baby diapers or hot meals among others. A location marker on a globe indicated where the selected items would be donated. The third landing page offered the same gifts but in a pseudo-set called "Global Survival Kit". Each time an item was selected, instead of location markers, a line grew further around the globe. A closed circle meant that all six items were funded, but potential donors could choose as many gifts as they wanted. 21% of the people in the third group decided to donate all six gifts, compared with only 5% on the second page and 3% in the cash condition. ([Barasz, John, Keenan & Norton, 2017](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=52665))

We like to tick off things that we got done. In the days before paper and pen, our memories had to perform the whole job. To keep track, our mind fixates on unfinished tasks – the so-called *Zeigarnik effect*. The psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik had noted that waiters could remember open orders more efficiently than those that had been delivered. Further experiments had proven that we could recall uncompleted or interrupted things better than things we’ve finished ([Zeigarnik, 1927](http://codeblab.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/On-Finished-and-Unfinished-Tasks.pdf)).


## Examples


### Wizards
No, I don't mean those bearded guys with hats. We're talking here about the step-by-step process that takes the user through a sequence of input requests. It's a popular design pattern to split up complex forms into smaller more digestible tasks. Display either a progress bar or the number of steps that are left to indicate users how long the whole process will take. An indicator will also act as a reminder of how much time they've already invested – time that [would be lost](/loss-aversion/) should they not complete the process.

### Progress bars
People [want](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=317459) progress indicators. They give feedback about the current status but also stimulate the desire to continue a process. Each time the progress bar moves through our actions, we feel the positive effects of dopamine which motivates us to repeat the previous task. This phenomenon is also referred as *self-directed learning* which is likely evolutionary developed to maximize learning opportunities and therefore to reproduce human intelligence ([Herd, Mingus & O'Reilly, 2010](https://grey.colorado.edu/mediawiki/sites/mingus/images/c/c0/HerdMingusOReilly10.pdf)).

### Starting with a high percentage
Make your progress indicator prominent and show already after the first completed task a relative high completion rate. But don't overdo it. Keep it plausible. We are more motivated to reach a goal the closer we get to it ([Kivetz, Urminsky & Zheng, 2006](http://www.quilageo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Goal-Gradient_Illusionary_Goal_Progress.pdf)).

### Counters and notifications
You might have heard about the [Inbox Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk) approach: a technique developed by Merlin Mann to keep your email inbox almost all the time empty. For many people triggers a counter, that indicates incomplete tasks, discomfort which we try to avoid. According to a study from 2002, reacted employees to 70% of their unread emails [within 6 seconds](https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/489/3/Ease%2525202002%252520Jackson.pdf). These interruptions can be instant gratifications. They give us little dopamine rushes every time we complete something, which in turn [reinforces us](/rewards/) to lurk for more distractions.

### To-do lists
Dropbox had an excellent “Get Started” checklist. The user was asked to refer friends to them, connect social media accounts or to follow Dropbox on Twitter which resulted in more free space. This growth hack was for sure one reason why Dropbox became a multi-billion dollar company. Providing small achievable quests can produce small wins when completed. But not all users will be seduced solely by the need of complete. In this case, give them extrinsic rewards as Dropbox does.
