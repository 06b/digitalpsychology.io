Triggers are anything that cues us to complete a particular action. They tell us what to do next and come in the form of internal and external triggers.

External triggers are all around us. They target our senses and remind us to take a particular action. It can be something obvious like a "Click here" button but also something like a delicious smell of fresh coffee and cake, while you're walking down the street.

Internal triggers, on the other hand, are impulses which come from within us. Memories, emotions or situations provide the information for what to do next. For example, the fear of losing out a moment triggers some people to take a photo and post it on Instagram. Internal triggers are a major factor for building habit-forming products and are the drivers for the growth of billion dollar companies.


## Studies

Ivan Pavlov demonstrated that dogs could be conditioned to salivate at the sound of a bell. He trained the dogs to respond in that way by ringing a bell before feeding them. This learning procedure came to be known as classical conditioning. ([Pavlov, 1927](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Pavlov/))

According to BJ Fogg's behavior model, three elements must be present for the desired behavior to occur: motivation, ability, and trigger. In other words, it has to bring value, be simple to complete and should draw attention. If one or more is missing, the desired action will not happen. ([Fogg, 2009](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1541948.1541999))


## Examples


### Paid media
Everything from web banners to paid search marketing is used to acquire new customers and falls within the category of paid triggers. It's an effective way to expose your product's name to a broad audience within a short time. Paid channels will continue to evolve with more features aimed at providing better audience targeting and thus better experiences for the visitors. According to the research from [Ascend2](http://research.ascend2.com/2017-content-marketing-distribution-survey-summary-report/), say 67% of the marketers interviewed that search engine marketing is the most effective paid channel to distribute content, followed by social media ads with 50%.


### Owned media
A high-quality digital presence is critical to success. Owned media refers to the content you create and publish on channels you own. That includes the main website, blogs, newsletters but also any social media presence which all act as an extension of your brand. The more owned media you have, the more potential external triggers you have to provide to acquire new visitors. Owned media leads to earned media.


### Earned media
In contrast to paid media, which gets in front of people by payment, refers earned media to exposure you've gained through word-of-mouth. Earned media is the tweet that praises your service. It's the blog post that mentions your product and got shared by thousands. Establish yourself and your business as the leader in your niche which will give you a ton of [social proof](/social-proof/) and credibility. Not everybody will like your brand. By publicly acknowledging hate against your business you will increase the positive word-of-mouth created by your brand lovers ([Monahan, Espinosa & Ortinau, 2017](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314266211_Hate_Does_Not_Have_to_Hurt_The_Influence_of_Hate-Acknowledging_Advertising_on_Positive_Word_of_Mouth_An_Extended_Abstract)).


### Call to action
Every CTA like a button or some other form of graphic or text which guides your users and tells them what to do next is an external trigger. Even the smallest tweaks in copy, color, position or size can lead to huge lifts in the conversion rate: Black and Decker, for example, saw a [17% increase in click-through rate](https://blog.optimizely.com/2014/07/03/black-decker-discovers-big-win-in-buy-now-vs-shop-now-test/) by using "Buy now" instead of "Shop now." Even two words on a button can have a huge impact on essential metrics.


### App icon on home screen
We [touch our phone 2,617 times a day and unlock it 76 times](https://blog.dscout.com/mobile-touches). Whenever we see the grid of apps, we're confronted with potential triggers. Red badges, which signal what we've missed, increase the sense of urgency in opening specific apps even more.


### Push notifications
According to Localytics, [52%](http://info.localytics.com/blog/52-percent-of-users-enable-push-messaging) of all mobile users enable push notifications on their phone. If done right, they can have open-rates up to [80%](http://blog.thanx.com/push-notification-open-rate-statistics-50-80) and are therefore effective external triggers to persuade people to complete certain tasks. Good push notifications are well-timed, explicit and spark someone's curiosity.


### Software updates
Have you ever been remembered through app updates that you have an app installed which you've forgotten that it's on your phone? Releasing updates strategically can be a part of your marketing to retain existing users. Mobile systems like iOS and Android have update notifications built in. In addition to that or for other platforms like web and desktop you can send product update emails to inform your users about new features.


### Browser extension
Look at your menu bar in your browser. How many third party add-ons do you see there? Each time you open your browser you notice consciously or unconsciously these shiny icons. For many companies like Pinterest, Buffer or Pocket are browser extensions an essential part of a seamless workflow.
