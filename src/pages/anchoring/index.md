We tend to rely too heavily on one piece of information, mostly the first one when making a decision or estimating the value of uncertain objects. This initial "anchor" value is used as a mental reference point which might influence the choice people will make.


## Studies

Two groups of high school students were asked to compute, within 5 seconds, the product of the numbers one through eight (1 x 2 x 3...) or reversed (8 x 7 x 6...).  Because of the short time, they had to estimate the product after their first multiplications. These first results anchored their final answer. The median estimate of the first group was 512, while the median for the descending sequence was 2,250. Correct is: 40,320. ([Tversky & Kahneman., 1974](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/185/4157/1124))

Job seekers who anchor first and high in salary negotiations usually get a higher wage. ([Thorsteinson, 2011](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2011.00779.x/abstract))

Judges score better than others on some cognitive illusions like the framing effect (treating economically equivalent gains and losses differently) or representativeness heuristic (ignoring background statistical information in favor of individuating information) but are equally prone to the anchoring effect. ([Guthrie, Rachlinski & Wistrich, 2001](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=257634))


## Examples

Let's see how the anchoring effect can be leveraged for digital products and services. Because anchoring is often associated with the judgment of numerical values, we'll find here examples solely related to pricing strategies.


### Present the highest price first

Anchor the price of the most expensive package of your product to the user's mind by listing it first. This order makes the subsequent plan seem like a bargain.

### Present the lower price first

Wait, didn't you just say the opposite? If the price difference is not too high, try to anchor the lower price. Therefore the slightly more expensive but significantly more valuable offer looks like a steal.

### List higher-priced unrelated products

A study shows that exposure to higher prices, even for unrelated products can impact people's willingness to pay for goods and services. ([Nunes & Boatwright, 2004](https://msbfile03.usc.edu/digitalmeasures/jnunes/intellcont/Incidental%20Prices-1.pdf))

### Expose users to any high number
Anchoring works with any number, no matter whether that number is a price. ([Adaval & Monroe, 2002](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/338212?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents))
